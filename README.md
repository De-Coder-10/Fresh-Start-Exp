## 📌 Vision

Fresh Start aims to be the unofficial student dashboard that:
- **Looks clean**
- **Loads fast**
- **Actually works**

It’s a tool made *by a JIIT student, for JIIT students* — optimized for survival, sanity, and maybe some productivity.

> 🫂 *If it saved your day, consider sharing it with someone who's still stuck in the old portal.*
